## Project 1 
### Logic Gates

Starting from an elementary NAND logic gate, built an array of more complex logic gates, i.e., And, Or, Mux, Xor, etc.

## Project 2
### ALU
Constructed an adder chip and ALU, which executes all the arithmetic and logical operations

## Project 3
### Registers & Program Counter
Used a D Flip Flop circuit, which enables storing state in a chip, to construct a series of registers and a Program Counter

## Project 4
### Assembly
Wrote Assembly Language programs using the Hack Machine Language

## Project 5
### Full Computer
Constructued CPU, ROM, and RAM units leading to a full scale Computer

## Project 6
### Assembler
Created Hack assembler in Python to translate Hack Assembly Language into Hack Binary Machine Language
